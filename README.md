## Project Description: Plant Seedlings Classification using Computer Vision

### Introduction:
In an era where modernizing agriculture is crucial, the manual process of identifying plant seedlings remains labor-intensive and time-consuming. The integration of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning offers a transformative opportunity to streamline this process, enhancing efficiency and sustainability in farming practices.

### Objective:
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of plant seedlings into 12 distinct species, as provided by the Aarhus University Signal Processing group and the University of Southern Denmark. By automating plant recognition, agricultural workers can focus on higher-order decision-making, ultimately improving crop yields and promoting sustainable practices.

### Data Overview:

Utilizing a dataset that includes images of unique plants and their corresponding labels, the model will accurately determine a plant's species from images. This innovative approach has the potential to significantly reduce manual labor in agriculture, making a lasting impact on the industry.

Let's pave the way for smarter, more efficient farming! ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ¾
